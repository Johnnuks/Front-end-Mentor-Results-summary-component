## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Nothing new, just working on some flexbox knowledge and gradient color work, like:

```css
.rate {
  background-image: linear-gradient(hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1), hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0));
  height: 70%;
  width: 175px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

Positioning in the DOM, with multiple div's inside other div's, is something i'm working on getting better
